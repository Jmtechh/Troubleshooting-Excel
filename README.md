If Excel is not opening, the next step is to go to the Add-ins section by clicking on File and then Options. From there, you can troubleshoot by disabling specific add-ins at startup to identify which ones may be causing the issue

Finally, if your Excel file won’t open, you may need to adjust the security settings in the Trust Center to mark the file as trusted, allowing it to open within your work environment.
